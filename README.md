# PyNotes

Extremely simple app using Flet and TinyDB for operation.
Mostly created to help take notes for studying and recalling information, so the code quality might be a bit lacking.

Pyinstaller can easily be used to create an executable, due to the use of Flet it does have potential to be used on other platforms than pc, maybe even hosted in browser, but that is completely untested and unsecure.
